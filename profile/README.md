Edge is a **simple**, **Modern**, and **batteries included** template engine for Node.js. Edge is similar to writing JavaScript. If you know JavaScript, you know Edge.

## Features

- Edge supports all JavaScript expressions, hence you will not have to learn a custom dialect.
- Inbuilt tags for writing conditionals, loops, and including partials.
- Support for components with slots and context API.
- Iconify integration to render SVG icons.
- Extensible API. 80% of Edge features are implemented using the public API

## Why should I use Edge?
If you like the simplicity of using backend template engines and have been looking for one that feels modern, refreshing, and does not force you to learn a new language, then Edge is for you.

If you swim in the `<your-frontend-framework>` ecosystem, you do not need Edge. Imagine, you never opened this website ðŸ˜‰
